# Documentation for BookingJini Icon Set

### How the Icons are Built:
The icons in the BookingJini icon set are created using Adobe Illustrator. They are meticulously designed and named to ensure clarity and easy identification. The following steps outline the process:

### Illustrator Icon Design and Naming:
Each icon in the BookingJini icon set is designed using Adobe Illustrator. The designer carefully crafts the visual representation of each icon, paying attention to detail and aesthetics. Furthermore, the icons are given descriptive and meaningful names for easy reference and understanding.

### Exporting Icons to SVG:
Once the icon design process is complete, the icons are exported to the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. SVG is a widely supported vector image format that ensures the icons can be scaled and displayed without losing quality across different devices and screen sizes.

### Generating Icon CSS with Icomoon.io:
To create an icon library and streamline the usage of the icons, the exported SVG files are uploaded to https://icomoon.io/app/#/select, an online platform that facilitates the generation of CSS for icons. By uploading all the SVG files as a single set, the platform generates the necessary CSS code for each icon, making it easier to integrate and utilize the icons in web and mobile applications.

Note: It is important to upload all the SVG files as one set on icomoon.io to ensure the CSS code is generated correctly for the entire BookingJini icon library.

By following this process, the BookingJini icon set is created, allowing developers and designers to access a comprehensive collection of visually appealing and well-named icons for their projects.

This document provides guidelines on creating icons for a grid system and ensuring consistent thickness. Follow the steps below:

### 1. Choose a Grid System:
Select a grid system that suits your requirements. Common options include 16x16, 24x24, or 48x48 grids. The grid system helps maintain alignment and consistency across icons.

### 2. Utilize the Golden Ratio for Grid System:
To create a visually pleasing grid system, consider using the golden ratio (approximately 1.618) as a guide. This ratio can help establish balanced proportions and spacing within the grid. Refer to the provided image for reference on how to apply the golden ratio.

### 3. Maintain Consistent Icon Thickness:
It is crucial to ensure consistent thickness for your icons. This helps create a cohesive visual style throughout the icon set. If you are using a 24x24 grid system, it is recommended to keep the icon thickness at 2 pixels.

By following these guidelines, you can create icons that align with GitHub's design principles, providing a unified and visually appealing experience.
